This piece of code was initialized written inhouse for a linux based internet cafe. Since linux was lacking a proper
Internet cafe software. I was decided to write it for that particular internet cafe. They were at that time
running an internet cafe called mkahawa, but it couldn't keep up with the latest changes on linux (it was running on
buntu 10.04), and yet we were migrating to ubuntu 14.04.
